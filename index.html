          <h1>ASHTON'S PORTFOLIO</h1>
          
          <div id="About-Me"> <h1>About Me</h1><p>My name is Ashton Brown and this upcoming school year I will be a freshmen in high school.
          I like to ride my bike, play video games with my friends, hangout with friends, roller skate, and go bowling with my friends and family.
          I really like to ride my bike on a nice day with my brothers, because of the breeze you feel when you ride your bike.
          The other reason I like to ride my bike is because it makes me calm and relaxed.
          I love playing video games with my friends especially Fortnite, but by myself I usually play GTA 5 and I love it.
          I can do many things on there while having fun;
          typically when I'm on GTA 5 I make money and have fun.
          Sometimes on GTA I just drive around with the fast cars that I have.
             When I'm hanging out with my friends, we usually like to play basketball.
           You might find me roller skating sometimes and I'm pretty good at it; I usually go with my family but sometimes with my friends if we're up to it.
             I sometimes challenge my brother to race against me while roller skating. Sometimes he says yes and during those times I tend to lose.
             When I go bowling with my family or friends, we always play 2 games of bowling; It's a 50/50 chance of me winning or losing. However, 100% of the time, everyone had a great time.

                    This is a gif from a famous game called GTA 5. I love GTA 5, I usually play online with random people but when my brothers are on the game they play with me.
                         While I'm playing online I usually do heist, drive around, and spend money.
                         I think GTA is pretty fun but with friends its even more fun.
                         Doing the story mode missions is the only way to finish the game. <br>
                         P.S. My favorite story mode character is Franklin.
                         Franklin is a cool dude, in fact Franklin, Trevor, and Michael are all cool.
                         On story mode I use cheat codes like infinite ammo and super jump.

               <div id="gallery-desc">
                    The man above is "Ghost" and he is from Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.
                         I used to play Modern Warfare but now not so much.
                         Sometimes when I'm on Call of Duty I play warzone with my friends and brothers.
                         I don't usually play Call of Duty I just play GTA all the time.
                         When I played Call of Duty I had a lot of great times playing with my friends and brothers.
                         Maybe I'll play Call of Duty again soon but only warzone.
                         I only want to play warzone because I don't want to spend money on a game that I won't play a lot.

                    Have you ever played Forza Horizon? Well,
                    there are different versions of Forza, but the one I own is Forza Horizon 4.
                     I love playing Forza but I don't play it a lot anymore. Hmmm maybe I should start playing it a lot more??
                    <br>
                    Forza is a car game and you can get a Bugatti and many different cars.
                    I do have the Bugatti in Forza and it's very fast.
                    I have another car that I think is faster than a Bugatti and I found it from a barn find.
                    Barn finds are where you get a mission and you have to go to the location that is shown on the map and then you get a car from it.
                     I think I will play Forza a lot more because it is really fun.

                    This game is called Rocket League.
                    I just started playing Rocket League again for a challenge that I had to do.
                    After I did those challenges I realized that it's very enjoyable.
                    Rocket League has to be in my top 3 favorite games to play since my video game collection is small.
                    In Rocket League I ussually play 4v4's or 2v2's, sometimes I play 3v3's but I play the 4v4's and 2v2's the most.
                    I'd say that I'm pretty decent at Rocket League and that I can play better if I do some practicing
                    I play Rocket League with online people or my brothers.

                    I wrote my code in Visual Studio Code.
                    Rock Paper Scissors was our very first project that we had to make during our first summer immersion
                    In the beginning it was a bit challenging, but I got the hang of it pretty fast.
                    FreeCodeCamp and Replit were among the many resources that were helpful.
                    When I ran my code for the first time, it didn't work. However, after a few tries it worked.
                    Overall rock paper scissors was a pretty cool project.

                    I made a python file that converts temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
                    The logic behind the temperature converter is that when the user inputs a temperature to convert that it shows a different color everytime its hot or cold.
                    For example, when I would put 95 in and I ran it the color would show as red; while when I put 30 degrees it would show as blue.
                    This one was more challenging then the Rock Paper Scissors project that we did.
                    The rock paper scissors and the temperature converter are the only projects that we did so far.
                    These projects were really good and I think I did very good on both of the projects that we did.
                    I would hope to do more projects like these the next summer which is summer 2 and maybe I can do some over the fall.

          <div id="Experience" style="clear: left;">
               <h3>Experience</h3>
               <p>My experience here with the Hidden Genius Project has been wondurful so far, I've had so much fun making new friends and interacting with one another.
               When I first started the Hidden Genius Project I thought that 7 weeks were going to be a waste of my summer.
               I later realized that this program is so fun and I made a bunch of new friends/brothers that I will never forget.
               During the summer immersion, we go on trips every Friday. Our first ever business trip was a trip to Dave and Buster's.
               I learn so much from the trips; for example, last week we went to Sharp Dressed Man and I learned what to wear to an interview and I also learned how to tie a tie.
               I am enjoying this program and I would like to do it again to learn more code.
               The websites that help us learn how to code on is FreeCodeCamp, and Replit.
               In FreeCodeCamp, we learn how to build a cafe menu with CSS and for HTML we learned how to do a CatPhotoApp.
               We have done many games, activities, and competitions to learn more about one another and share our own experiences with each other.

                    <h4>Goals</h4>
                    <p1>I have a lot of goals that I want to accomplish in my life and one goal I would like to accomplish is to study so I can succeed in life.
                     My other goal is to turn in all of my work and possibly get ahead while I'm at The Hidden Genius Project.
                      One other goal I would like to achieve is to get a good education in school and get good grades.
                       Another goal I would like to accompish is to make a lot of money with the job I would like to have and I want to have a successful life.
                    I wish to accomplish all of these goals so I can help my family if they need help and also my friends.</p1>
