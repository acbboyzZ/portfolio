          <div id="About-Me"> <h1>About Me</h1><p>My name is Ashton Brown and this coming school year I would become a freshmen of high school.
          I like to ride my bike,play video games with my friends, hangout with friends, rollerr skate, and go bowling with my friends and family.
          I really like to ride my bike on a nice day with my brothers because of the breeze you feel when you ride your biike.
          The other reason I like to ride my bike is because it makes me calm and relaxed.
          I love playing video gamees with my fiends especially Fortnite but by myself I usually play GTA 5 and I love it.
          I can do many things on there while having fun.
          Usually when I'm on GTA 5 I make money and have fun.
          Sometimes on GTA I just drive around with the fast cars that I have.
             Hanging out with my friends are super fun. I usually play basketball with them.
             I go roller skating sometimes and I'm pretty good at it, I usually go with my family but sometimes with my friends.
             I sometimes ask my brother to race me while roller skating and he says yes but at the end I always lose.
             When I go bowling I usually go with my firends and family and its pretty fun.
             We always play 2 games of bowling and sometimes I win and sometimes I lose but at the end everyone had a great time.

                    This is a gif from a famous game called GTA 5. I love GTA 5, I usually play online with random people but when my brothers are on the game they play with me.
                         While im playing online I usually do heist, drive around, and spend money.
                         I think GTA is pretty fun but with friends its even more fun.
                         Sometimes I go in story mode and do missions so I can finish the game.
                         My favorite story mode character is Franklin.
                         Franklin is a cool dude infact Franklin,Trevor, and Michael are all cool.
                         On story mode I use cheat codes like infinite ammo and super jump.

               <div id="gallery-desc">
                    The person in this gif is named Ghost and he is from Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.
                         I used to play Modern Warfare but I dont anymore.
                         Sometimes when Im on Call of Duty I play warzone with my friends and brothers.
                         I dont usually play Call of Duty I just play GTA all the time.
                         When I played Call of Duty I had a lot of fun especially with my friends and brothers.
                         Maybe i'll play Call of Duty again soon but only warzone.
                         I only want to play warzone because I dont want to spend money on a game that I wont play a lot.

                    This is a gif from a game called Forza Horizon.
                    here are different versions of Forza but the one I have is Forza Horizon 4.
                     I love playing Forza but I dont play it a lot anymore, maybe I should start playing it a lot more.
                    Foza is a car game and you can get a bugatti and many different cars.
                    I do have the bugatti in Forza and its very fast.
                    I have another car that I think is faster than a bugatti and I found it from a barn find.
                    Barn finds are where you get a mission and you have to go to the location that is shown on the map and then you get a car from it.
                     I think I will play Forza a lot more because it is really fun.

                    This game is called Rocket League.
                    I really enjoy playing Rocket Leage and I just relized how fun it is.
                    I just started playing Rocket Leage again for a challenge that I had to do.
                    Then after I did those challenges I relized that Its very enjoyable.
                    Rocket Leage has to be in my top 3 favorite games to play since I have a little bit of games.
                    In Rocket Leage I ussually play 4v4's or 2v2's, sometimes I play 3v3's but I play the 4v4's and 2v2's the most.
                    I'd say that im pretty decent at Rocket Leage and that I can play better if I do some training.
                    I play Rocket Leage with online people or my brothers.

               <div class="gallery-desc">
                    This is a classic game of rockpaperscissors and we made a rockpaperscissors code.
                    We made the code on a website called Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio Code makes you make different codes like rockpaperscissors.
                    rockpaperscissors was our very first project that we had to make during our camp.
                    In the beginning it was a bit challenging but I got a hang of it pretty fast.
                    I got the hang of it pretty fast because of FreeCodeCamp and Replit.
                    Those websites really helped me with the other project that we did too.
                    When I ran my code for the rockpaperscissors it didn't work at first but then after a few tries it worked.
                    Overall rockpaperscissors was pretty cool and that I would like to learn more projects.

               <div class="gallery-desc">
                    This is a gif that shows a thermometer.
                    I made a project that was called tempatureconverter.
                    The tempatureconverter is when we make a code so that it shows a different color everytime its hot or cold.
                    For example when I would put 95 when I ran it the color would show as red and when I pul 30 degrees it would show as blue.
                    This one was more challenging then the rockpaperscissors project that we did.
                    The rockpaperscissors and the tempatureconverter are the only projects that we did so far.
                    These projects were really good and I think I did very good on both of the projects that we did.
                    I would hope to do more projects like these the next summer which is summer 2 and maybe I can do some over the fall.

          <div id="Experience" style="clear: left;"><h3>Experience</h3><p>My experience here with the Hidden Genius Project has been wondurful so far, i've had so much fun making new friends and interacting with one another.
               When I first started the Hidden Genius Project I thought that 7 weeks were going to be a waste of my summer.
               I later relized that this camp is so fun and I made a bunch of new friends that I will never forget.
               During the camp we go on trips every friday and our first ever business trip was a trip to Dave and Buster's.
               I learn so much from the trips for example last week we went to Sharp Dressed Man and I learned what to wear to an interview and I also learned how to tie a tie.
               I am enjoying this camp and I would like to do it again to learn more code.
               The websites we learn how to code on is FreeCodeCamp, and Replit.
               In FreeCodeCamp we learn how to build a cafe menu with CSS and for HTML we learned how to do a CatPhotoApp.
               I think the websites are very useful especially FreeCodeCamp.
               We have also done many games to learn everyone's name and its a compotition and also really fun.

               <div id="Goals"><h4>Goals</h4><p1>I have a lot of goals that I want to accomplish in my life and one goal I would like to accomplish is to study so I can succeed in life.
                     My other goal is to turn in all of my work and possibly get ahead while im at the Hidden Genius Project.
                      One other goal I would like to achieve is to get a good education in school and get good grades.
                       Another goal I would like to accompish is to make a lot of money with the job I would like to have and I want to have a successful life.
                    I wish to accomplish all of these goals so I can help my family if they need help and also my friends.</p1></div>
